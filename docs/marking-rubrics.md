# Marking Rubrics

## Team project

### Late release submission policy

_Applies to all sprints._

If a sprint release is late for less than 24 hours: penalty of 5 marks.

If late for more than 24 hours: penalty at the instuctor's discretion, min. 10 marks.

### Sprint 1

For the first sprint, you will deliver:

* [Project Requirements document](https://ualberta-cmput401.github.io/course-docs/project-documentation/#project-requirements) 
* An early version of the [Software Design document](https://ualberta-cmput401.github.io/course-docs/project-documentation/#software-design) (focusing on high-level architectural design)
* [Project Management document](https://ualberta-cmput401.github.io/course-docs/project-documentation/#project-management)
* [Teamwork document](https://ualberta-cmput401.github.io/course-docs/project-documentation/#teamwork)

Your documentation must be stored as markdown files in the `/docs` folder in the `main` branch of your GitHub repository. Use [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/) and [GitHub Pages](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/deploying-your-docs/) to deploy the documentation.

Example: <https://ualberta-cmput401.github.io/example-documentation/>.

Besides, you may start implementation.
