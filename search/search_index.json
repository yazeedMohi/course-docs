The course introduces some of the best practices in software product and project management and the architectural and technological impacts on management. Group projects require specification and initial design or redesign of a software system. Prerequisites CMPUT 301, or permission of the instructor. Objectives and Learning Outcomes This course aims to provide students with an authentic experience of working with a client as a team member. We are partnering with the Community Service-Learning Office to create opportunities for you to work on projects identified by community-based organizations as serving their needs. In the process, you will have to apply your knowledge on analyzing requirements, designing, developing, documenting, and testing software, and develop new technical skills working with new programming languages and tools. You will also acquire new knowledge on how to work with others, how to interact with clients to elicit their needs and explain how the delivered software meets these needs, how to negotiate task sharing and manage one\u2019s tasks, how to plan and how to mitigate risks. Lecture Schedule and Assigned Readings The weekly topic schedule is likely to be updated during the term; in general terms, the topics to be covered are: Personality and Teamwork Software Product Management Software Requirements Software Development Process Software Architecture Estimation and Planning Project Management User-Interaction Design Testing Measurement There is no required textbook for this course. Each module will cite online resources as required readings. You will find the links to each topic on the course eClass page. Coursework and Evaluation Team Project (70% total) Your team will deliver the project through an evolutionary process in five sprints. All project deliverables will be submitted through the project repository and must be available for inspection by the TAs by 8 pm two days before the sprint demo (for example, if your sprint demo is on Monday, you must submit a release on Saturday, no later than 8 pm). Make sure that your release is on GitHub before 8 pm, there will be a penalty for late submissions (the late submission policy is outlined in the Sprint Rubrics document). The team is marked as a whole (left section in the table below), i.e. each team member receives equal marks. We may retroactively update your sprint marks based on your contribution factor . It means that your sprint scores may get either higher or lower. The coefficients depend on: How your team feels about your contribution to the project (based on the peer feedback forms). The instructor and TA's assessment of your individual contribution. We will review your contribution and apply individual coefficients twice during the term: After Sprint 3 (individual coefficients will be applied to Sprints 1, 2, and 3), After the end of the project (individual coefficients will be applied to Sprints 4 and 5). Team Project Grade Structure The team is marked as a whole, individual coefficients may be applied based on individual contribution. Component Weight Sprint 1 12% Sprint 2 12% Sprint 3 12% Sprint 4 12% Sprint 5 12% Screencast 3% Presentation 3% Final assessment by client 4% Total 70% Individual Work (30% total) Besides the final exam, your individual work component involves: One assignment (due date per class schedule) Reflection forms (four peer-review forms (one after each Sprint) and a final reflection), due by the end of each Sprint demo day (5) and by the end of the class (1) In-class participation Component Weight Assignment 5% Reflection forms 3% Participation 7% Final exam 15% Total 30% Participation Students are expected to attend and participate in all classes and labs, including the class hackathon. Each class may include one or more individual or group exercises. Each lab usually includes a stand-up meeting and may also include other individual or group activities. Missed participation work will not be excused. Letter Grades The conversion of your total numeric coursework score to a final grade will be based on interpreting the guidelines of the descriptors, letter grading system, and four-point scale as defined in Section 23.4 of the University Calendar. That is, grades are assigned on what we judge to be \"failure,\u201d \"minimal pass,\u201d \"poor,\u201d \"satisfactory,\u201d \"good,\u201d or \"excellent\" performance in the context of the class. We do not use a particular distribution to do the conversion but instead use our judgment of how your score reflects the mastery of the course material. Typically, you need to be above the median to earn at least a 3.0 or B. Grades are unofficial until approved by the Department and/or Faculty offering the course. Deferred Exams A student who cannot write the final examination due to incapacitating illness, severe domestic affliction or other compelling reasons can apply for a deferred final examination. Such an application must be made to the student's Faculty office within two working days of the missed examination and must be supported by a Statutory Declaration or other appropriate documentation (University Calendar \u00a723.5.6 ). Deferred examinations are a privilege and not a right; there is no guarantee that a deferred examination will be granted. Misrepresentation of facts to gain an excused absence is a breach of the Code of Student Behavior. See the general GFC rules on Absence from Exams . Student Responsibilities Academic Integrity Code of Student Behaviour The University of Alberta is committed to the highest standards of academic integrity and honesty. Students are expected to be familiar with these standards regarding academic honesty and to uphold the policies of the University in this respect. Students are particularly urged to familiarize themselves with the provisions of the Code of Student Behaviour (see link above) and avoid any behaviour which could potentially result in suspicions of cheating, plagiarism, misrepresentation of facts and/or participation in an offence. Academic dishonesty is a serious offence and can result in suspension or expulsion from the University. All forms of academic dishonesty are unacceptable at the University. Any suspected offence will be reported to the Faculty of Science. Anyone who is found in violation of the Code of Student Behaviour may receive a sanction. Typical sanctions include conduct probation, a mark reduction or a mark of 0 on an assessment, a grade reduction or a grade of F in a course, a remark on the transcript, and a recommendation for suspension or expulsion. Conduct of Exams Conduct of Exams In-Class Conduct Recording and/or distribution of course materials is allowed only with the prior written consent of the instructor.

To achieve this goal, motivated, balanced, and diverse teams should be formed. Criteria The teams will be formed according to the following criteria: Personal preferences for projects Belbin team roles Career goals diversity Balance of more and less experienced students Starting Fall 2022, team formation is automated. The algorithm will form teams based on the criteria above. Detailed description of the optimization model: Forming CMPUT 401 Teams as a Mixed Integer-Linear Program (developed by Dr. Zachary Friggstad) . Process We will use the following process to form teams: Students fill the Belbin Team Roles Questionnaire (on paper) and calculate their results Students fill the Student Experience Form, indicating, among other questions, their assessed team roles, skills and career goals - link will be posted on eClass Students rank the projects based on their personal preferences - link will be posted on eClass Instructor will assign the students into teams, using the criteria above. The best effort to accommodate students\u2019 preferences will be made. However, we can not guarantee that every student will be assigned to the projects of their top choice. Dates Please refer to the live schedule (available on eClass). Dealing with non-cooperative team members policy Recommended steps If a team member refuses to carry their workload on the project, below are suggested steps. Have a constructive conversation with the uncooperative team member (see details below). If the problem persists, the team should notify their TA by email (with the instructor cc-ed). Based on that, a meetings with the team and/or the uncooperative team member will likely be scheduled. Suppose the team member still refuses to contribute. In that case, the team may notify the uncooperative member by email that they are in danger of being fired. A meeting will be scheduled to discuss what might happen next, including the possibility of firing a non-contributing team member. If there is no subsequent improvement, the team should notify the individual by email (copy to the TA and instructor) that they are no longer with the team. Firing could have significant consequences. A fired team member might have an option to work alone on an individual project assignment. An individual project is significantly more challenging than a team project because it requires an individual to independently complete the same deliverables. It should be considered as the last chance, not a free pass. Handling constructive conversations with your teammates We get frustrated about someone not contributing, or we get concerned or anxious about a deadline. It\u2019s to be expected on all projects. Do we just keep that frustration to ourselves and do extra work, not telling that person? Does that frustration come out in other ways? Is it possible that the person is not even aware that s/he is viewed this way? That\u2019s not fair to that person either! We are not protecting someone from bad news. We could actually be contributing to their career downfall. Now\u2019s the time to learn as students, so you don\u2019t have to learn on the job when you have more on the line. Five steps for a constructive conversation: What I notice and observe What is my concern How I interpret it What it means to me What change I would like to see (request SMART actions: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time-Bound) Example of a constructive conversation You and your non-contributing teammate Steve. You: I see that you are behind with your project tasks. (Step 1) Steve: Yeah, probably I'm a little behind, ... You: I'm concerned about that because our next sprint deadline is pretty soon. (Step 2) Steve: Oh, I see. I\u2019m also really concerned about it! You: Maybe, you've got too much on your plate and are feeling stressed. I just want to check-in. (Step 3) Steve: Yes, I've got so many assignments and readings. I\u2019m very stressed out, ... You: This project is really important for me, and I would like to develop a cool app here.

You: Please finish the XYZ module until Friday so that our team has enough time to review the code and finalize deployment. (Step 5) Steve: Sure, I'll do it. Make sure to: Assume positive intent Listen non-judgementally Connect to feelings and concerns Reflect honestly on the intentions and needs involved.

In Sprint 2, you will refine and finalize the project documentation. After Sprint 2, you will update the Project Management page. All other documents will be considered final after the end Sprint 2. Example: https://ualberta-cmput401.github.io/example-documentation/ . Project requirements The purpose of this document is to explain the requirements of your software product. It should have the following sections. Executive summary Write a short overview of the project (one paragraph), including the following: The problem that the product will solve (use your client\u2019s language); Value proposition (what will be the essential functionality or your product); Who will use your product; How your product will be used. Project glossary Define any special terminology in the application domain (i.e., the terms that your client is using; not development, programming, or implementation terms). User stories User stories should be formulated using the standard notation (\u201cAs a [persona], I [want to], [so that].\u201d). Think carefully about who will be the users of your product, and formulate user stories for specific personae. Your collection of user stories should be complete and cohesive, it must clearly show how exactly the client\u2019s requirements will be met with your product. For each user story, you must formulate detailed acceptance tests. User stories must be prioritized using the MoSCoW method. Similar products List competitive or similar products that you may use as a reference and/or inspiration. Open-source products List any open-source products that might somehow benefit your product, e.g.: As a reference or inspiration; As an external interface that you might want to use; As a source of information and insights. Be creative and think outside the box. Technical resources List useful informational resources around the tools and frameworks that you plan to use. Software design The software design document should be consistent with the requirements document, it should document and explain how the design will actually deliver the required features. There is no one \u201cright\u201d way to create this document. Use your best judgement to choose the notations and tools. In any case, make sure that this document is meaningful with respect to your system. Be selective in what you portray about the architecture -- don\u2019t go into too much detail but don\u2019t make it overly superficial either. Suppose a new developer comes to the project: describe what is not obvious and definitely important to know. As for practical guidelines, each diagram should be described and motivated; you should use a consistent naming convention, and key elements should be annotated with further comments to explain their roles. Before getting started, refresh your understanding of UML, this book is recommended (chapters 1, 3, 4): https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/uml-distilled-a/0321193687/ . High-level architecture Most likely, you will not use any UML notation for the architecture diagram. You are free to invent your own style of architecture diagram. Include a useful legend. Refer to the examples discussed in class for guidance. What\u2019s the right scope of the architecture diagram? \u201cOne that\u2019s big enough to be meaningful, small enough to be comprehensible, and cohesive enough to make sense.\u201d Study this chapter to feel the gist of creating good software architecture diagrams: Make sure that your diagram includes all layers. You can have more than one diagram if your project\u2019s complexity requires it. Major data elements If you adopt an object-oriented style for your system, you can present the data as a UML Class diagram. If your system is not naturally object-oriented, you can create an Entity Relationship diagram (ERD). Interaction scenarios To document the dynamic behaviour of the system, for each interesting feature, you should develop a UML Sequence diagram, with components as \u201cobjects\u201d and calls between them. Think, which features of your system should be described as sequence diagrams. Low-fidelity user interface Finally, you should develop low-fidelity sketches/wireframes of a few key screens. At this stage, it\u2019s important to show the overall look and feel of your app, as well as the high-level user-interaction design. Low-fidelity wireframes are usually black and white. Looking at the wireframes, anyone should be able to get an idea of what will be developed. Test your wireframes with your client, encourage them to give feedback. Project management There are two sections in this document: Storymap Project plan (or backlog) You should start the document with a storymap. Include all five sprints. Don't forget to indicate estimation of each user story (in story points). The second section should define a project plan. Sprint 1 For Sprint 1 , you should include the following: Due date Tasks to be completed (include asignees and due dates) Most Sprint 1 tasks will not be related to any user story. For example, you will be creating the project documentation, setting up the project repository, setting up the project management tools, etc. Sprint 2 For Sprint 2 , you should include: Due date List of user stories to be completed (include estimation of each user story in story points) Estimated sprint velocity Tasks to be completed (include asignees and due dates) The tasks should correspond with the user stories. Sprints 3, 4, and 5 For the remaining sprints, you should include: Due date List of user stories to be completed (include estimation of each user story in story points) Estimated sprint velocity Do not list the tasks yet. You will be planning them later, before the start of each sprint. GitHub Issues Based on the planned tasks , set up and keep current Github Issues. Teamwork This document includes two sections: Team canvas Belbin team roles Team canvas The Team canvas should be based on the template found here http://theteamcanvas.com/use /. You may choose the Basic or the Full version of the canvas. Use the instructions to facilitate the Team canvas session. An in-person session is recommended. However, if you choose an online format, you may use Mural or any other whiteboard tool. While creating your Team canvas, think about the high-level roles of each team member (e.g.: Scrum Master, Product Owner, Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, QA Engineer, DevOps Engineer, UI/UX Designer, Floater etc.). Think about which roles are necessary for your project. Each team member may be assigned to multiple roles, and each role may include multiple team members. There are two special Scrum roles that must be defined for each sprint: Scrum Master Product Owner You may choose to elect a Scrum Master and Product Owner for the whole project or switch roles for each sprint so that more team members can get product management experience. A good overview of skills and responsibilities of a Scrum Master and a Product Owner: https://productmanagerhq.com/scrum-master-vs-product-owner/ . Belbin team roles For each of the team member, list their preferred , manageable and least preferred roles. Then, list all nine Belbin roles and, for each role, provide a brief description and a list of people who are able to fulfill that role.","title":"Project Documentation"},{"location":"project-documentation/#project-documentation","text":"You will be working on these documents during Sprint 1.

While creating your Team canvas, think about the high-level roles of each team member (e.g.: Scrum Master, Product Owner, Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, QA Engineer, DevOps Engineer, UI/UX Designer, Floater etc.). Think about which roles are necessary for your project. Each team member may be assigned to multiple roles, and each role may include multiple team members. There are two special Scrum roles that must be defined for each sprint: Scrum Master Product Owner You may choose to elect a Scrum Master and Product Owner for the whole project or switch roles for each sprint so that more team members can get product management experience.
